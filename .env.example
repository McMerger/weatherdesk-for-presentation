# WeatherDesk Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# Backend API URL (optional - uses localhost:9002 by default)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:9002

# Development Configuration
# The app uses a mock weather service, so no API keys are required!
# However, if you want to use a real weather API in the future:
# OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Note: This app works out of the box with mock data
# No configuration needed for development!
